# Practical Example

::: tip Just want to try it by yourself?

Skip to the [Quickstart](./quickstart) or head over to our
[Migration Guide](./recipes/migration.md) to migrate your existing project to
Kita.

:::

No matter how good we are at explaining, nothing is better than an example to
prove to you how powerful Kita is in just a few lines of code.

Below is the simplest Fastify server you've ever seen:

::: code-group

```ts {4,5,6} [src/index.ts]
import { Kita } from '@kitajs/runtime';
import fastify from 'fastify';

fastify().register(Kita).listen({ port: 1227 });
```

:::

Just by creating a file at `src/routes/index.ts` and exporting a `get` function,
you already have a `GET` route registered in your Fastify server.

::: code-group

```ts [src/routes/index.ts]
export function get() {
  return { hello: 'world' };
}
```

:::

## Running the Server

As Kita runs at compile time, you need to run the `kita build` command before
running or compiling your code:

::: code-group

```sh [Terminal]
npx kita build
```

:::

Now, run your server:

::: code-group

```sh [Terminal]
$ npx ts-node src/index.ts
# npx tsc && node dist/index.js is also valid
```

:::

## Testing the Route

Done! Your server is already running and you can access the `GET` route at
`http://localhost:1227`.

::: code-group

```sh [Terminal]
$ curl http://localhost:1227
{ "hello": "world" }
```

:::

**But wait, there's more!** Kita, along with [Scalar](https://scalar.com/), Kita
generates a graphical interface for you to visualize, edit, and test your API:

            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Let's change something!

Life isn't perfect, and eventually, you'll receive new specifications to
implement... _Let's do this?_ **Notice how simple it is to transform your routes
into something more complex.**

1. We'll change the method from `GET` to `POST`.

2. We'll add a `Body` containing a `name: string` field _(which must have a
   minimum of 5 characters)_ and an `age: number` field _(which must be greater
   than 18)_.

3. We'll also use the `Authorization` header to validate whether the user has
   permission to create a new user.

4. We'll also use a `Query` of `?fail=<boolean>` which has a default value of
   `false`.

5. Lets also return the newly created user with an automatically generated `id`.

6. We can also return a `Forbidden` status if the Authorization is invalid and a
   `400` error if the request comes with `?fail=true`.

7. It's always recommended to add descriptions for the fields, so we'll do that
   too.

The final result should look something like this:

::: code-group

```ts [src/routes/index.ts]
import type { HttpErrors } from '@fastify/sensible';
import type { Body, Header, Query } from '@kitajs/runtime';

interface PostBody {
  /** @minLength 5 */
  name: string;

  /** @minimum 18 */
  age: number;
}

/**
 * Creates a new user
 *
 * @operationId createUser
 */
export function post(
  body: Body<PostBody>,
  fail: Query<boolean> = false,
  authorization: Header<'authorization'>,
  errors: HttpErrors
) {
  if (authorization !== 'please let me in') {
    throw errors.forbidden('Invalid Authorization');
  }

  if (fail) {
    throw errors.badRequest('You asked for it');
  }

  return {
    id: Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000),
    name: body.name,
    age: body.age
  };
}
```

:::

**Yes, you read it right!** Just by using typing and annotations, your route is
already **documented**, being **validated at runtime**, and **secure** against
attacks like
[Prototype Pollution](https://portswigger.net/web-security/prototype-pollution).

## What happened here?

I know you might not fully understand all the power that is now in your hands.
Let me break down everything you just did:

- By changing the function name from `get` to `post`, the route is automatically
  changed to `POST`.

- By adding a `body` parameter of type `Body<PostBody>`, Kita understands that
  the request body needs to be passed there, as well as Kita reads the typing of
  the `PostBody`, validates the body at runtime to ensure it's in the format of
  `PostBody`, and generates the necessary documentation.

- The `PostBody` interface has only 2 fields, `name` and `age`, so ONLY these
  fields will be present at runtime, extra fields present in the `JSON` will be
  ignored.

- By annotating with `@minLength 5` and `@minimum 18` on the `name` and `age`
  fields, respectively, Kita ensures that these conditions will be respected at
  runtime.

- By adding a `fail` parameter of type `Query<boolean>` and the default value of
  `false`, Kita understands that it needs to extract the value from the query
  string (`?fail=true`) and that if not specified, it should use the value
  `false`.

- By adding an `authorization` parameter of type `Header<'authorization'>`, Kita
  understands that it needs to extract the value from the `Authorization` header
  and that this value is mandatory.

- Inside the function, by throwing any errors coming from the `errors`
  parameter, Kita understands that it's an HTTP error and will return the
  correct status as well as document it in OpenAPI.

- By returning an object with the `id`, `name`, and `age` fields, Kita
  understands that this is the return of the function and generates the
  necessary documentation and validation.

  Yes, if you return an object different from the specified typing, Kita will
  throw an error at runtime because your clients expect a different signature
  than what is being returned.

## Result

First, you need to run the `kita build` again to re-perform the static analysis
of your code and regenerate the necessary files:

::: code-group

```sh [Terminal]
$ npx kita build
$ npx ts-node src/index.ts
```

:::

After running the server, you can already access the `POST` route.
