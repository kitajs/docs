# Async

`async`/`await` inside components are 100% supported.

When any child or sub child of a component tree is a `Promise<string>`, the
whole tree will return a promise of html string.

If no async components are found, the result will be simply a string, and you
can safely cast it into a string.

```tsx
import assert from 'node:assert';
import { setTimeout } from 'node:timers/promises';

async function Async() {
  await setTimeout(1000); // simulates work
  return <div>Async!</div>;
}

function Sync() {
  return <div>Sync!</div>;
}

const async = (
  <div>
    <Async />
  </div>
);

assert(async instanceof Promise);

const sync = (
  <div>
    <Sync />
  </div>
);

assert(typeof sync === 'string');
```

A `JSX.Element` will always be a string. Once a children element is a async
component, the entire upper tree will also be async.

## Suspense component

The only problem when rendering templates is that you must wait for the whole
template to be rendered before sending it to the client. This is not a problem
for small templates, but it can be a problem for large templates.

To solve this problem, we provide a `Suspense` component that combined with
`renderToStream()` rendering method, will stream a fallback component while it
waits for his children to be rendered.

```tsx
import { Suspense, renderToStream } from '@kitajs/html/suspense';

function renderUserPage(rid: number | string) {
  return (
    <Suspense
      rid={rid}
      fallback={<div>Loading username...</div>}
      catch={(err) => <div>Error: {String(err)}</div>}
    >
      <MyAsyncComponent />
    </Suspense>
  );
}

// Html is a string readable stream that can be piped to the client
const html = renderToStream(renderUserPage);
```

<br />

> [!NOTE]  
> The `renderToStream()` is returns a native node/bun stream, head over to our
> [suspense-server](./examples/suspense-server.tsx) example to see how to use it
> with node:http, Express or Fastify servers.

<br />

The above example would render `<div>Loading username...</div>` while waiting
for the `MyAsyncComponent` to be rendered.

When using `Suspense`, you cannot just call the component and get the html
string, you need to use the `renderToStream` function to get a stream that can
be piped to the client with updates. Otherwise, the fallback would render
forever.

As the result of any JSX component is always a string, you must use the `rid`
provided by `renderToStream` into all your suspense components, this way we can
identify which suspense is for which request and be able to render concurrent
requests.

Suspense also accepts async fallbacks, but it blocks rendering until the
fallback is resolved.

```tsx
import { Suspense } from '@kitajs/html/suspense';

function renderTemplate(rid: number | string) {
  return (
    <Suspense
      rid={rid}
      fallback={<MyAsyncFallback />}
      catch={(err) => <div>Error: {String(err)}</div>}
    >
      <MyAsyncComponent />
    </Suspense>
  );
}
```

The above example would only return anything after `MyAsyncFallback` is
resolved. To catch async fallback errors, you must wrap it into a
[`ErrorBoundary`](#error-boundaries).

<br />

## Error boundaries

The same way as promises must be awaited to resolve its own html, errors must be
caught. Outside of [suspense](#suspense-component) components, you can use the
provided error boundaries to catch errors.

```tsx
import { ErrorBoundary } from '@kitajs/html/error-boundary';

function renderTemplate() {
  return (
    <ErrorBoundary catch={(err) => <div>Error: {String(err)}</div>}>
      <MyAsyncComponent />
    </ErrorBoundary>
  );
}

// If MyAsyncComponent throws an error, it will render <div>Error: ...</div>
const html = await renderTemplate();
```

Error boundaries will only work for errors thrown inside async components, for
sync components you must use `try`/`catch`.

```tsx
function MySyncComponent() {
  try {
    const data = syncDbQuery();
    return <Username name={data.username} />;
  } catch (err) {
    return <div>Error: {String(err)}</div>;
  }
}
```

Error boundaries outside suspense components will only catch errors thrown by
the fallback component. You must use the Suspense's `catch` property to handle
errors thrown by its children components.

```tsx
import { ErrorBoundary } from '@kitajs/html/error-boundary';
import { renderToStream, Suspense } from '@kitajs/html/suspense';

function renderTemplate(rid: number | string) {
  return (
    <ErrorBoundary catch={<div>Only catches fallback errors</div>}>
      <Suspense
        rid={rid}
        fallback={<MyAsyncFallback />}
        catch={<div>Catches children errors</div>}
      >
        <MyAsyncComponent />
      </Suspense>
    </ErrorBoundary>
  );
}

const html = renderToStream(renderTemplate);
```

The above example would render `<div>Children error</div>` if `MyAsyncComponent`
throws an error, or `<div>fallback error</div>` if `MyAsyncFallback` throws an
error. If both throws an error, the first error will be changed to the second
error as soon as the children error is thrown.

<br />

## `JSX.Element` might be a `Promise`?

> [!NOTE]

> Until [#14729](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/14729) gets

<br />

JSX elements are mostly strings everywhere.

However, as the nature of this package, once a children element is a async
component, the entire upper tree will also be async. Unless you are sure that no
other component in your entire codebase is async, you should always handle both
string and promise cases.

```tsx
// It may or may not have inner async components.
const html = <MyAsyncComponent />;

if (html instanceof Promise) {
  // I'm a promise, I should be awaited
  console.log(await html);
} else {
  // I'm a string, I can be used as is
  console.log(html);
}
```

## Api

### `renderToStream`

Transforms a component tree who may contain `Suspense` components into a stream
of HTML.

There's two ways of using `renderToStream`:

With a `rid` parameter, to identify which suspense is for which request.

If you are using a framework or some kind of code that already generates a
unique request id per request, just like
[Fastify's request.id](https://fastify.dev/docs/latest/Reference/Request/), you
can simply renders your component tree with it and pass it to `renderToStream`.

```tsx
import { renderToStream } from '@kitajs/html/suspense';

// If you are literally doing this, please use the 2nd way XD
let requestId = 0;

function handleRequest() {
  const rid = requestId++;
  const html = renderToStream(<LayoutWithSuspense rid={rid} />, rid);
  // pipe html to the client
}
```

If you do not have easy access to a unique request id, you can pass a callback
as the first parameter to `renderToStream` that will be called with the request
id.

```tsx
import { renderToStream } from '@kitajs/html/suspense';

function handleRequest() {
  const html = renderToStream((rid) => <LayoutWithSuspense rid={rid} />);
  // pipe html to the client
}
```

### `renderToString`

Just like `renderToStream`, but only resolves when the whole tree is rendered.

::: warning

This method completely throws away the suspense feature, and will render the
whole tree before returning the string.

This is only useful for testing environments or when you don't care about the
time it takes to render the whole tree.

:::

```tsx
import { renderToString } from '@kitajs/html/suspense';

async function handleRequest() {
  const html: string = await renderToString((rid) => (
    <LayoutWithSuspense rid={rid} />
  ));
}
```
